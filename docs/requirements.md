Software requirements specification
===================================

The idea for the hacker's manual is to provide a useful starting point for
learning any new technology. The system will achieve this goal by two means:
  - Provide short summaries / crash course on each topic
  - Link to a curated list of resources (blog posts/tutorials/books/code) on the topic


Users

The primary intended reader audience is beginner and intermediate programmers who
want to pick up new skills.

The primary contributors will be intermediate to advanced programmers who want to
