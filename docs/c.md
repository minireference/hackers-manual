The C language is notorious for fostering memory management bugs, including:
  - Accessing arrays with indexes that are out of bounds;
  - Using stack-allocated structures beyond their lifetimes (see use after free);
  - Using heap-allocated structures after freeing them (see use after free);
  - Neglecting to free heap-allocated objects when they are no longer required (see memory leak);
  - Failing to allocate memory for a pointer before using it;
  - Allocating insufficient memory for the intended contents;
  - Loading from allocated memory before storing into it;
  - Dereferencing non-pointers as if they were pointers.
