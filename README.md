Hacker's manual
===============
A collection of links to computer-related topics like programming, tooling, system administration, and startups.

TODO:
-----
  - come up with RE to match all links and surrounding title + notes


Phase 1
-------

  - Manual cleanup and organize repo of .txt files
  - Automatically process all files and convert to .md files with YAML links: metadata header


Phase 2
-------

  - decide on final data format (possibly just regular .md files)

        [ This is the title ]  
        https://this.is/the/link.html
        Free form of various text and extra notes
        that could go on for many lines

    We can generate the "Links" section for each article automatically using the .yaml metadata
